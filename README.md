# WiredIn

This project features a website that serves as a platform for women in tech to search for mentors. The objective is to connect mentees and mentors based on interests and skills. 

Built with React.
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular UI library for building web apps. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a powerful tool for building javascript apps that bundles all of your code and shows immediate changes while you're editing.

## Prerequisites

You will need node.js and npm.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main page template React uses to build your site–it imports `index.jsx` to kick things off. When you're ready to share your site or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

← `src/`: This folder contains all the files React will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder 📁

React defines site components in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), an extended version of JavaScript, so you'll see lots of `.jsx` files in the project.

← `src/index.jsx`: This is the root of your React app. The index script is imported in the site home template `index.html`. If you add libraries like [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com) or [redux](https://react-redux.js.org), you'll insert their providers here. The `<HelmetProvider`> is an example of a provider you'd use.

← `src/app.jsx`: The base for defining your React app, this script imports the components that make up the site content. The `index.jsx` file imports the App script. The router (from [wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) 🐰) is also imported here.

← `src/styles`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. You have [a lot of](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) importing options for CSS including CSS modules if that's your jam.

← `src/components/router.jsx`: One of the most important parts of a single page app is the router. It's how we know what page to show–the code maps the paths to the Home and About components. We're using [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter), a tiny minimalist router. You could replace it for something like [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

← `src/components/seo.jsx`: When you share your site on social media, you'll want to make sure the meta tags are correct and that you've got an image. All of the settings for this file are in `src/seo.json`.

### Hooks 🪝

← `src/hooks/`: [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are a powerful way to provide interaction with your app.

← `src/hooks/prefers-reduced-motion.jsx`: For accessibility reasons, some users will indicate in their system settings that they prefer motion effects to be minimized–this allows you to hold off on these effects in such cases.

← `src/hooks/wiggle.jsx`: The wiggle effect animates elements, as you'll see if you hover over the image (or text below it) on the homepage. You can apply the effect anywhere you like in the site as outlined in `TODO.md`.

### Pages 📃

← `src/pages/`: These files include components that specify the content of the Home and About pages. Each one is defined as a function and referenced in `router.jsx`. The content is built into the page outline specified in `app.jsx`.

← `src/pages/about.jsx`: The content of the About page, defined as a component function.

← `src/pages/home.jsx` The content of the Home page, also defined as a component function. The page includes the animated effect on hover, and title change effect on click (which is also a handy demo of using state data in React).
